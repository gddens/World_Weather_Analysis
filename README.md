# World Weather Analysis
The purpose of this repository was to create maps with locations of hotels using a combination of both the OpenWeather API to get local weather information, as well as the Google Maps API to get information on what is the nearest city from a randomly generated array of coordinates, as well as directions between four cities for a proposed vacation itinerary.
